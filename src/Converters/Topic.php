         * but I see some issues, esp with the content
         * its full of crappy html-ish tags, which don't work in wp. EG [strong][/strong]
         * How do we fix that?
         * Probably going to need to iterate across the LegacyTopics and replace the bad tags urls/ strings
         *
         * Dates on the topics inside of their forum are wrong initially after import.  Just need to do a BuddyBoss Repair " Recalculate last activity in each discussion and forum"
         *
         * Also attachments and forum links are going to break.  How are we going to redirect all the old forum links....
